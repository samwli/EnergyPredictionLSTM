# LSTMs_for_subseasonal_energy_pred
Subseasonal (1-4 week) energy prediction using LSTMs. Please use the provided code to process data and make predictions and plots. For original netcdf data used to process HDD proxy too large to provide here, please contact me. Initial results are shown in the plots folder: week 1-4 predictions are weekly average predictions, with lead time 0-3 weeks.
